To speed up the operation, we suggest you to work in parallel with your group's colleagues. In particular, using the same code, each component of the group can be in charge of downloading a subset of pages (e.g., the first 100). **PAY ATTENTION:** Once obtained all the pages, merge your results in a unique dataset. In fact, the search engine must look up for results in the whole set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Save your data]** It is not nice to restart a crawling procedure, given its runtime. For this reason, it is extremely important that for every time you crawl a page, you **must** save it with the name `article_i.html`, where `i` corresponds to the number of articles you have already downloaded. In such way, if something goes bad, you can restart your crawling procedure from the *i+1*-th document."
